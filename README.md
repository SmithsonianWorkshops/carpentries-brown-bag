SI Carpentries Community Chats
==============================

About the Carpentries Community Chats
----------------------------------

The Carpentries Community Chats are a series of monthly lunchtime gatherings for Smithsonian-affiliated staff, fellows, interns, contractors, etc. to discuss topics relating to Smithsonian Data or Software Carpentry workshop content. 

We are hoping that these Community Chats will enable us to continue the learning we started in our two-day workshops, while fostering a community of workshop "alumni" who can collaborate and support one another in our data and coding endeavors. (That said, if you are an SI-affiliated individual but you have not had a chance to participate in a workshop, you are still welcome to attend these Community Chats!)

For more information on the SI Carpentries group, please visit the SI Data Science [Carpentries, Genomics, and Data Science training at the Smithsonian](https://datascience.si.edu/carpentries) page.

Carpentries Community Chats Schedule and Locations
---------------------------------

The Community Chats will generally be held on the fourth Wednesday of every month from 1pm-2pm EDT. On occasion, Community Chats may be moved due to holidays; please check the detailed schedule for the exact dates.

Schedule: https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/carpentries-brown-bag/wiki/Schedule

Until further notice, all Community Chats will be conducted online via Zoom. The link for the Zoom meeting will be emailed out shortly before the Brown Bag; please sign up on the **Carpentries-announce** listserv to receive emails about Community Chats and other SI Carpentries events. For help, please email SI-DataScience.

Presentation Materials
------------------------

Usually, each Community Chat includes an informal presentation on a topic relating to material presented in a Data or Software Carpentry workshop. Following the meeting, presentation slides, materials, and links are archived in this repository. We are thinking in updating the format to add office hours and other activities. 

Get Involved!
--------------

The Community Chats are intended to be informal and collaborative. After the presentation, there will be an "open mic" time for us to go around and talk about any interesting projects we're working on, any new tools we've discovered, and anything interesting happening in the wider world of data.

We also need presenters! Generally, we're looking for 10 minute talks relating to the material covered in our workshops, i.e. working with and presenting data in spreadsheets, OpenRefine, R, Python, and SQL. These talks would be a great opportunity to demonstrate an interesting tool or a useful workflow that others could use in their own work. For a list of presentation ideas, consult (and add to!) the Topics page in the wiki.

To sign up to present, please log into your GitHub account and edit the Schedule page of the wiki directly, using the grey **Edit** button in the upper right.

We encourage anyone who is interested to give a presentation, including those who are relatively new to the world of data and software and those who would like to get more experience with public speaking. The Carpentries and our Community Chats are meant to be welcoming, encouraging, and inclusive environments that help us improve our skills, learn new things, and strengthen our Smithsonian community!
