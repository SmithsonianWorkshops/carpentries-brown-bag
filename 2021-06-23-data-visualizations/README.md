# Carpentries Brown Bag June 2021: Data Visualization Show-and-Tell

For this month's SI Carpentries Brown Bag, we will be showing off our data visualizations! These visualizations can be on any topic and can be via any medium; feel free to show us a graph you made for a recent publication, a dashboard you created to monitor stats on a current project, a web application with an interactive map, or even something [more outside the box (or bag?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/jnn7to/distribution_of_snickers_letters_in_my_halloween/).

If you would like to share a visualization, please come to the Brown Bag ready to share your screen, or provide us a link we can use to view your finished product. In addition, please be ready to very briefly tell us about your visualization - what data you used, what your visualization shows, and what tools you used to produce it.  

This is a great opportunity for alumni of a Data or Software Carpentry workshop to revisit and practice some of the skills that were taught in the workshop, which is the best way to reinforce learning. We encourage folks at all experience levels to present what they are working on - even if you consider yourself a beginner or a novice, we want to see what you've created!
