I built my own separate repository to demonstrate this talk: [https://github.com/MikeTrizna/docsite-demo](https://github.com/MikeTrizna/docsite-demo). Here is the outline from the README there.

Also here is the link to the demo site itself: [https://miketrizna.github.io/docsite-demo](https://miketrizna.github.io/docsite-demo).
