# "Wrangling Wednesday": Volcanic Eruptions

For this Carpentries Brown Bag, we will be taking a look at a dataset on volcanic eruptions published by the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program. This dataset was a featured dataset for the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project, a weekly virtual event where data-minded folks work on the same dataset to practice their data wrangling and visualization skills.

The TidyTuesday writeup and data repository is available here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2020/2020-05-12

We have found several visualizations that TidyTuesday participants produced from this dataset. For this Brown Bag, we will take a look at these visualizations, pick one of particular interest, and work together as a group to figure out how to recreate it!
